This project is designed to manipulate images in the PNM format.
Currently this program can reduce the size of the image, 
concatenate images side by side as well as top to bottom, and blend
two images together.

The majority of image processing funcitons lie in the filters files
which hold the classes for each different type of image manipulation.
